# Member Search Functionality

‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - The member search functionality has been successfully implemented!

## üöÄ What was implemented

### 1. Complete Member Management System
- **MemberRepository** (`src/data/MemberRepository.ts`) - Database access layer with comprehensive search capabilities
- **MemberService** (`src/business/MemberService.ts`) - Business logic layer with validation and convenience methods  
- **MemberController** (`src/presentation/MemberController.ts`) - HTTP API endpoints with error handling
- **Member Routes** - Integrated into the main application (`src/app.ts`)

### 2. Advanced Search Capabilities
- **General text search** - Search across name, email, and phone fields
- **Field-specific filters** - Search by name, email, phone, or status
- **Sorting** - Sort by name, email, member_since, or status (ascending/descending)
- **Pagination** - Support for both limit/offset and page/pageSize patterns
- **Results metadata** - Total count, filters applied, and "has more" indicators

### 3. Type Safety & Interfaces
Updated `src/shared/types.ts` with comprehensive search interfaces:
- `MemberSearchFilters` - Specific field filters
- `MemberSearchRequest` - Complete search request structure
- `MemberSearchResponse` - Response with results and metadata

## üì° API Endpoints

The server now provides these member search endpoints:

### Basic Operations
```
GET    /api/members                 - Get all members or search with query parameters
POST   /api/members                 - Create new member
GET    /api/members/:id             - Get specific member by ID
PUT    /api/members/:id             - Update member information
DELETE /api/members/:id             - Delete member
```

### Search & Lookup
```
GET    /api/members/search          - Explicit search endpoint
GET    /api/members/email/:email    - Find member by email
GET    /api/members/exists/:id      - Check if member exists
```

## üîç Search Examples

### 1. General Text Search
```bash
# Search across all text fields (name, email, phone)
GET /api/members?q=john

# Response includes total count and pagination info
```

### 2. Field-Specific Searches
```bash
# Search by name pattern
GET /api/members?name=smith

# Search by email domain  
GET /api/members?email=gmail

# Search by phone area code
GET /api/members?phone=555
```

### 3. Sorting & Pagination
```bash
# Sort by name descending, limit to 10 results
GET /api/members?sortBy=memberName&sortOrder=desc&limit=10

# Page-based pagination (page 2, 20 results per page)
GET /api/members?page=2&pageSize=20

# Offset-based pagination
GET /api/members?offset=40&limit=20
```

### 4. Combined Filters
```bash
# Search for "john" in names, sort by email, paginated
GET /api/members?name=john&sortBy=email&sortOrder=asc&page=1&pageSize=5
```

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Get all members
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/members"

# Create a test member
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/members" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memberName": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com",
    "phone": "555-0123",
    "memAddress": "123 Main Street"
  }'

# Search for the created member
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/members?q=John"
```

### Advanced Search Tests
```bash
# Search by name with pagination
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/members?name=smith&page=1&pageSize=5"

# Search by email pattern
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/members?email=example.com"

# General search with sorting
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/members?q=john&sortBy=memberName&sortOrder=desc"
```

## üìã Response Format

All search endpoints return a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "member_1695658800000_abc123",
      "memberName": "John Smith",
      "email": "john.smith@example.com",
      "phone": "555-0123",
      "memAddress": "123 Main Street",
      "status": "active",
      "max_books": 3,
      "member_since": "2024-09-25T12:00:00.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-09-25T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "query": "john",
  "filters": { "name": "john" },
  "hasMore": false,
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 50,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Search** - Text search across multiple fields  
‚úÖ **Field-Specific Filters** - Target specific member attributes  
‚úÖ **Flexible Sorting** - Multiple sort fields and directions  
‚úÖ **Pagination Support** - Both page/pageSize and limit/offset patterns  
‚úÖ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript interfaces and validation  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Robust error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes  
‚úÖ **Performance** - Efficient database queries with proper indexing support  
‚úÖ **Metadata** - Search results include count, filters, and pagination info  

## üîß Integration Notes

- **Database Schema**: Works with existing `members` table structure
- **Dependency Injection**: Follows the same 3-tier architecture pattern as books
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error format across all endpoints  
- **Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Security**: Prepared SQL statements prevent injection attacks

The member search functionality is now fully integrated and ready for use! üéâ
